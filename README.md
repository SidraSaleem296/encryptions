This repository contains code for a simple encryption and decryption system called Barrac. It involves a series of checks including agent verification, keyword validation, and more to ensure secure communication.

## Usage

1. Run the script `encryption.py` for message encryption.
2. Run the script `decryption.py` for message decryption.

## Instructions

1. **Encryption:**
   - Enter your message and a key in the range of [1 - 26].
   - Choose 'E' to encrypt the message.
   - The encrypted message will be displayed in base64 format.

2. **Decryption:**
   - Provide the base64-encoded encrypted message and the correct key used for encryption.
   - Choose 'D' to decrypt the message.
